## Dream diary continuation years (as of September 2021) 📜

The first dream diary I wrote was the dream of April 6, 2007 (at least this dream is the oldest extant dream diary I wrote). Considering this day as a starting point, it has been 14 years since I started keeping a dream diary.

However, no dreams have been recorded during the subsequent 2008, 2010-2012 period. Therefore, it is hard to say that I have been keeping a dream diary for 14 years.

Let's calculate the dream diary history from the first day when you start to continue the dream diary. It was December 6, 2015 that I started writing a dream diary more than once a month. Starting from this day, it's been five and a half years since I started keeping a dream diary. It's longer than I expected.

In summary, the dream diary history is five and a half years in the narrow sense and 14 years in the broadest sense.

## About the music that played in my dream 🎵

I sometimes have music playing in my dreams. I categorize the music that plays in my dreams into two types. One is music that I know, and the other is music that I don't know. I can understand that the music I know is stored in my brain, but where does the music I don't know come from?

I have compiled the unknown songs played in my dream as music score data. The score data is available in musicxml format. [Please feel free to send me an issue if you have any other data format that you would like to see.](https://github.com/Asuimin/dream-database/issues)

## About lucid dreaming 🧠

I first learned about lucid dreaming on Monday, April 6, 2015 at 8:17 am. I kept a dream diary before I knew lucid dreaming (at least 18 dreams have been recorded by April 6, 2015).

Records show that I have lucid dreaming at least twice. It is recorded that both of them were scary dreams. In a scary dream, I realized that it was a dream and was trying to wake up from it as soon as possible.

Therefore, I have no good memories of lucid dreaming.
