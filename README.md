# Dream diary continuation years (as of September 2021) 📜

The first dream diary I wrote was the dream of April 6, 2007 (at least this dream is the oldest extant dream diary I wrote). Considering this day as a starting point, it has been 14 years since I started keeping a dream diary.

However, no dreams have been recorded during the subsequent 2008, 2010-2012 period. Therefore, it is hard to say that I have been keeping a dream diary for 14 years.

Let's calculate the dream diary history from the first day when you start to continue the dream diary. It was December 6, 2015 that I started writing a dream diary more than once a month. Starting from this day, it's been five and a half years since I started keeping a dream diary. It's longer than I expected.

In summary, the dream diary history is five and a half years in the narrow sense and 14 years in the broadest sense.
